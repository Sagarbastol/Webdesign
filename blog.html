					<h1 id="postHeading" >Technology and Its Effect on my Daily Life</h1>
						<div id="my-post">
						<h2 id="introduction">Technology</h2>
							<p>
								We’re living in an era of advanced technology, where every part of our daily lives is related to the science of craft in one way or another. 
								The continuous advancement of technology with the development of science effects our daily life directly.
								Our education system, communication system, way of entertainment and many sector of our life is effected by technology.
								Technology’s first reason to be introduced is for our maximum comfort and minimum time with minimum labour.
								Now a days, people around us also evaluate our way of living and standards with the comparison of technology we use.
								
							</p></br>
						<h2 id="education">How my education is effected?</h2>
							<p>
								As a student of twenty first century and also BIT, I think my way of learning will be totally incomplete if I don’t use technology in my studies as well as my daily life.
								Well, my day starts with the use of technology, alarm, and ends with technology, mobile, as well.
								My all the lectures, tutorials and homework are all recorded and assigned with the use of technology, i.e. internet, classroom, laptop, computer, and many others, which leads us towards the online education system. 
								I use my laptop to share my presentations and assignments with my lecturers and friends through internet.
								Thanks to the introduction of internet, that I can learn anything, anywhere. So, it is huge evolution of education system that there will always be a teacher who will teach me what I want to learn.
							</p></br>
						<h2 id="entertainment">How I use Technology for Entertainment?</h2>
							<p>
								My entertainment, housing and lifestyle are also affected by modern technology.
								Majority of items present in my house are all technology, which makes my life easier, organized and safer.
								Whenever I don’t find any work to do, I spend my days in front of computer/X-box playing games, watching videos in YouTube, streams in twitch.tv and listening to music with my headphone and sleep.
								There is fan whenever I feel too hot and heater wherever I feel cold. My foods and beverages are all kept in fridge for safety and making them fresh, which makes me fresh when I have beverages. 
								Well not forget televisions which I watch whenever I don’t have internet connections. 
								So, there is always something for my entertainment today.
							</p></br>
						<h2 id="communication">How my Communication Factor is affected?</h2>
							<p>
								The continuous advancement in technology have led to the appearance of numerous methods of electronic communication, such as social networking websites, emails, voicemails, and video chats.
								I am always in touch with the peoples I want them to be with me. 
								These advanced communication tech tools have helped us to eliminate time and distance as obstacles to effective communication. 
								I use e-mails, messenger, Instagram, my mobile which consists of sim cards which I can use to contact the people I connected with.
								Technology has improved cultural education by giving us opportunity to communicate with children and students of other country. 
								So, I can feel being around with my friends and loved ones since I can communicate with them any time I wish to.
							</p></br>
						<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
							<p>
								As a conclusion, I can say that technology has made my life easier and smoother.
								It has helped me to be get away from various problems that  I’ve faced till now like bad company, loneliness etc. and I have faith that it will help me getting better than today and lead the best life make my family especially my parents happy and proud of me.
								Well even though, it has helped me in every step, there are various thing I should be aware because every single component has adverse effect in an individual.
								Technology has made me a little passive and totally dependent.
								I believe that it will be very hard for today’s people to spend their day to day life without technology. I’ve seen people forget who’s on their side because they are spending time on their social account which makes us lacking on social behaviour.
								Hence, if we coordinate our daily activities with technology in good manner we will lead happy and most comfortable life.
